# vue-expense-tracker

This is a mini project that taught me how to use the Vue JS framework. I also learnt much on how Pinia is used together with Vue3 and I'd love to learn more in the future. I am now moving on to NuxtJS, a metaframework that allows me to easily integrate Server-side code with Vue3JS. 

I hope I'll come back to this project and add more features to it.
